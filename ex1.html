          <h2><b>Overview</b></h2>
          <p>
            Caltech researchers have found mathematical evidence suggesting
            there may be a "Planet X" deep in the solar system. This
            hypothetical Neptune-sized planet orbits our Sun in a highly
            elongated orbit far beyond Pluto. The object, which the researchers
            have nicknamed "Planet Nine," could have a mass about 10 times that
            of Earth and orbit about 20 times farther from the Sun on average
            than Neptune. It may take between 10,000 and 20,000 Earth years to
            make one full orbit around the Sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The announcement does not mean there is a new planet in our solar
            system. The existence of this distant world is only theoretical at
            this point and no direct observation of the object nicknamed "Planet
            9" have been made. The mathematical prediction of a planet could
            explain the unique orbits of some smaller objects in the Kuiper
            Belt, a distant region of icy debris that extends far beyond the
            orbit of Neptune. Astronomers are now searching for the predicted
            planet.
          </p>
          <h2><b>In Depth</b></h2>
          <p>
            In January 2015, Caltech astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike
            Brown announced new research that provides evidence of a giant
            planet tracing an unusual, elongated orbit in the outer solar
            system. The prediction is based on detailed mathematical modeling
            and computer simulations, not direct observation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This large object could explain the unique orbits of at least five
            smaller objects discovered in the distant Kuiper Belt.
          </p>
          <p>
            "The possibility of a new planet is certainly an exciting one for me
            as a planetary scientist and for all of us," said Jim Green,
            director of NASA's Planetary Science Division. "This is not,
            however, the detection or discovery of a new planet. It's too early
            to say with certainty there's a so-called Planet X. What we're
            seeing is an early prediction based on modeling from limited
            observations. It's the start of a process that could lead to an
            exciting result."
          </p>
          <p>
            The Caltech scientists believe Planet X may have has a mass about 10
            times that of Earth and be similar in size to Uranus or Neptune. The
            predicted orbit is about 20 times farther from our Sun on average
            than Neptune (which orbits the Sun at an average distance of 2.8
            billion miles). It would take this new planet between 10,000 and
            20,000 years to make just one full orbit around the Sun (where
            Neptune completes an orbit roughly every 165 years).
          </p>
          <h2><b>When was it Discovered?</b></h2>
          <p>
            Planet X has not yet been discovered, and there is debate in the
            scientific community about whether it exists. The prediction in the
            Jan. 20 issue of the Astronomical Journal is based on mathematical
            modeling.
          </p>
          <h2><b>What is its Name?</b></h2>
          <p>
            Batygin and Brown nicknamed their predicted object "Planet Nine,"
            but the actual naming rights of an object go to the person who
            actually discovers it. The name used during previous hunts for the
            long suspected giant, undiscovered object beyond Neptune is "Planet
            X."
          </p>
          <p>
            If the predicted world is found, the
            <a href="http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Page/Introduction"
              >name</a
            >
            must be approved by the International Astronomical Union. Planets
            are traditionally named for mythological Roman gods.
          </p>
          <h2><b>Why Do They Think It's There?</b></h2>
          <p>
            Astronomers studying the Kuiper Belt have noticed some of the dwarf
            planets and other small, icy objects tend to follow orbits that
            cluster together. By analyzing these orbits, the Caltech team
            predicted the possibility that a large, previously undiscovered
            planet may be hiding far beyond Pluto.
          </p>
          <p>
            They estimate the gravity of this potential planet might explain the
            unusual orbits of those Kuiper objects.
          </p>
          <h2><b>What’s Next?</b></h2>
          <p>
            Astronomers, including Batygin and Brown, will begin using the
            world's most powerful telescopes to search for the object in its
            predicted orbit. Any object that far away from the Sun will be very
            faint and hard to detect, but astronomers calculate that it should
            be possible to see it using existing telescopes.
          </p>
          <p>
            "I would love to find it," says Brown. "But I'd also be perfectly
            happy if someone else found it. That is why we're publishing this
            paper. We hope that other people are going to get inspired and start
            searching."
          </p>
          <p>
            "Anytime we have an interesting idea like this, we always apply Carl
            Sagan's rules for critical thinking, which include independent
            confirmation of the facts, looking for alternate explanations, and
            encouraging scientific debate," said Green. "If Planet X is out
            there, we'll find it together. Or we'll determine an alternate
            explanation for the data that we've received so far.
          </p>
          <p>"Now let's go explore."</p>
